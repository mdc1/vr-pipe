VRPipe can be used on Amazon's cloud service on EC2 nodes.
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html
Note that EC2 support is currently experimental. See notes at the end of this
document.


INSTALLATION
------------

After installing VRPipe's CPAN dependencies normally (see README), you also need
to manually install the perl module VM::EC2
cpan> install VM::EC2
Then when configuring VPRipe during the 'perl Build.PL' phase, choose 'ec2' as
the production and testing scheduler, and supply your security credentials when
asked. The log directories you configure (and any output roots you choose when
using VRPipe in production) must be placed on a shared disc that is auto-mounted
when the instance starts. It is up to you to create the shared disc system and
handle the mounting.

After installation, prior to testing, create ssh keys:
$ ssh-keygen -t dsa
and self-authorise:
$ cp ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2

Now create an image from the instance where you have installed everything you
need, then terminate it and launch a new instance based on the AMI you just
created.

Finally, continue with testing and beyond as per the README.


NOTES
-----

By default Amazon quotas you to a maximum of 20 EC2 instances. For real work
you probably want to get this increased:
http://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/ec2-request/

The test system is supposed to clean up after itself when the tests complete.
However a current issue can result in the vrpipe-server process not stopping,
which means the associated redis-server process and all instances launched
will still be running. You'll have to manually kill/terminate these processes
and instances.

It is possible that the current implementation will not scale efficiently when
using hundreds or thousands of nodes. Improved solutions may be coming in the
future...
